-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To do:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gameplay:

-make all creeps initially scientists, which when shot spawn creeps from different evolutionary lines	
-add increasing max energy to upgrade system

-implement snipertower
-while teleporter charges, change cursor into body gaining alpha from 0 to 0.5 (ghost)
-add message when level is over that player should move to scientist/next room
-add pickupsystem 
	-pickups are temporary boosts that can be used when needed
	-there might be one or more pickups on start
	-obtain with riding over it
	-when you obtain a pickup you lose the one you had if unused
	-pickups might be dropped by bosses
	-use with f or q
	-examples:
		-big damage to all creeps
		-temp creepdrops are worth double
		-temp range and shooting speed and dmg up
		-temp energydrain by creeps turns into gain
		-temp slow to all creeps
		-temp towers double shooting speed and up dmg

UI:
-show which weapon is currently selected 
-make buttons quickly slide in when opening menu, and out when closing it again
-add blurring overlay behind menu

Fixes:	

-fix memory-leak between switching worlds
-fix showing infotext when hovering over buttons ingame
-fix visual shift during tutorial
-fix weapon visible in wrong place in beginning
-fix player getting stuck after teleporting
-fix energy-spark (with draining)
-fix teleport charging and teleport location (middle of gridpoint), and charging-bar
-fix stack overflow by making upgradestat serializable to non-recursive

Optional:
-make a leveleditor (in c#?)
-add destroyable walls
	-player doesn't build them, only on level setup
	-good for level-design
	-creeps can't destroy them (though maybe there could be an explosive creep that does just that)
	-get damage like creeps from your gun
	-destroying them takes a lot of damage (therefore time and energy), can happen unintentionally when fighting creeps


-think of a way to have different creep-movement
	-move,stop,move,stop
	-move to a random reachable spot for some time, then to the goal
	-chase player (for energydrainers), not smart, but move towards player all the time
	-flyers
	-move backward
-make structure-placing have a cooldown
-show all waves coming in next wave bar
-make toggle for showing healthbars and sparks
-make it resizable (scale images, paths)
-make tile-interpreter (check walls to see which tiles to use or rotate)
-add tween fx
