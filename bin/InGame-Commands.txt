Story Sequence summary per level
	the introduction
		An advertisement for Universal Instant Communication (whichs allows R to function)
		A sequence depicting the robot applying for a job at the big spaceship
	The scientist (S) is alarmed and asks for help
	S thanks robot (R) and says we have to hurry, AI says to hold still and wait for instructions, S says not to trust AI
	AI asks again to stay in this room and wait for the creeps, S says to ignore AI
	AI loses temper about not listening, S says they are on the way to fix it
	S tells R about self destruct device (SDD)
	AI turns out to be cause of all this, and to be the imprint of someones brain, that S knows, AI sends fellow scientists who it did special experiments on
	S says that it is possible to take control of the ship, AI says only he managed to do it
	AI says he just wants to colonize some planets, just like other life forms, he just evolves a little quicker
	S knows where to get something special, AI disagrees
	S gives R the Kill all creeps bomb, AI doesn't like it
	AI gets enraged and sends creeps down a lane to chase R and S
	AI says he's S twin brother who got killed and was helped by S to research gene-tech to make another body, sends in failed clones of S
	AI suggests he was killed by S
	S asks AI why he cant just make a body for himself and be done with it, AI says power is nice
	AI asks who is causing more suffering, the AI or S and R, with all the killing and SDD and what not
	S explains that the AI got too powerful when stored too long in a ship computer, AI agrees
	AI explains that S helped him, but betrayed him
	S is revealed to actually be the cause of the accident that killed AI, and S admits he sort of wanted it to happen
	S gets electrified by the SDD, R gets the choice of destroying or protecting the SDD
	the choice
		If SDD was destroyed by creeps: Game Over. The robot is destroyed, the AI gloats and moves to colonize planets
		If SDD was protected: Game Over. The ship explodes and the universe can focus on the zillion other threats it faces
		If SDD was destroyed by R: The AI thanks R for destroying the SDD, then sends creeps to kill R's power generator
	The robot survives and becomes the AI of the ship, moving to colonize some planets
